.SH NAME
redapid.conf \- redapid(8) configuration file
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I redapid.conf
file specifies the configuration for the
.BR redapid (8)
program that implements the public API of the Tinkerforge RED Brick. For
further information see the
.BR redapid (8)
manpage.
.SH "FILE FORMAT"
The file is line-based, each newline-terminated line represents either a
comment or parameter of the form "name = value". Leading and trailing
whitespace on a line is ignored.

Any line beginning with a hash (#) is ignored. But a hash in the middle of a
line is used as-is, therefore it is not possible to put a comment at the end
of a parameter. The hash and following text becomes part of the parameter.

Only the first equals sign (=) in a parameter is significant. Whitespace before
or after the first equals sign is discarded. Leading and trailing whitespace in
a parameter name is ignored. Leading and trailing whitespace in parameter value
is discarded. Internal whitespace within a parameter value is used as-is.

The values following the equals sign in parameters are all either strings (no
quotes needed) or integers.
.SH PARAMETERS
.SS Logging
Each log message of
.BR redapid (8)
has a certain severity level attached to it. The visibility of log messages is
controlled by their severity levels.
.IP "\fBlog.level\fR" 4
Log messages with a severity level above or equal to the configured level are
shown, all other log messages are ignored.

Valid values are \fIerror\fR, \fIwarn\fR, \fIinfo\fR and \fIdebug\fR. The
default value is \fIinfo\fR. It means that log messages on error, warn and info
level are shown, but messages on debug level are ignored. This can be
overridden with the
.B --debug
command line option of \fBredapid\fR(8).
