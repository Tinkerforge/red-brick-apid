Description: Tinkerforge RED Brick API Daemon
 The RED Brick API Daemon program is part of the Tinkerforge software 
 infrastructure. It implements the interface of the RED Brick. Routing
 of the messages is done by the Brick Daemon, so the RED Brick API Daemon
 should always run together with the Brick Daemon.
